Attention! This project is still being developed.

Hello! I am glad to present You my BattleShips game written using technologies such as Vue3, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, jQuery and Vuex, using Options API. Created this for experience so if You saw something wrong with this code, pm me!

# Todo

  - [ ] Three level for difficulty ai
- [x] Battlefield config area
  - [x] Drag&drop ship system
  - [ ] Button to set random positions

  - [ ] Smart store of ship positions
    - [ ] (optional) save&load position feature
